# GeneticPrograming

A mixture of evolutionary algorithms and  genetic programming were used to develop solutions in multiple scenarios including the following:
  - Traveling Salesman
  - Symbolic Regression
  - Robot Generation

Algorithms used include the following

Random Search 
Hill Climber
Evolutionary Algorithm
  - Representation Used
    - Arrays
    - Binary heaps
  - Variations
    - Single objective
    - Multi-objective without deterministic crowding
    - Multi-objective with deterministic crowding
  - Selection methods: 
    - Tournament selection
  - Variation:
    - 2 point crossover
    - Mutation
  - Diversity Creation
    - Deterministic crowding
